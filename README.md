# A very good looking restaurant landing page I made using **React JS**

As soon as I saw this design made by IQONICDESIGN, I fell in love with its minimalist vibe, along with the modern features. The golden tone, in my opinion, suits very well this kind of landing pages and contrasts incredibly good with black & white.

### This website is responsive. The process of making it helped me fix several notions about React and website responsive-ness.
